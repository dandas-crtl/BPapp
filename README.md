Basic Blood Pressure Measurements Application

XCode software is necessary to view the full IOS simulation of the application. 

The SmartBP application is meant to be used to input blood pressure readings (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, and date and time of measurements.
Each Blood Pressure measurement is displayed as a cell in a table view. 

A video simulation of the IOS app simulation has been uploaded to this file labeled as BPappsimulation.mov.
